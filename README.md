* To create package.json outside of folders so it would be easier when it comes to the deployment part:
```
npm init -y
```
* Next install all the dependencies

```
npm install express mongoose dotenv
```

* Now create a file called server.js inside of backend folder. Which will be the entry point for our api. 

* add **type** inside of package.json to use module or modern way to import export

* Now write server.js file": [server.js](https://prnt.sc/pLRCYHB_d1TX)
